A simple game built with Phaser.js

## Disclaimer / Apology

This was built following along with a tutorial in the Phaser.js docs. I although I took some liberties organizing the code for readability, I was mostly focused on learning the library, so I did not organize it in the manner I generally would. For example, the major functions are just broken up by comments, and the concerns are only semi-separated.
